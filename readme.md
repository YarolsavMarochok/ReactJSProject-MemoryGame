# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game built with React JS. The objective of the game is to find and match pairs of cards with the same color. You can choose from four different game modes based on the number of cards.

## Game Modes

1. **1x4 cards**: A quick game with just 4 cards.
2. **2x4 cards**: A slightly more challenging game with 8 cards.
3. **3x4 cards**: An intermediate game with 12 cards.
4. **4x4 cards**: The most challenging mode with 16 cards.

## How to Play

1. Select a game mode from the available options.
2. The cards will be displayed face-down on the game board.
3. Click on a card to flip it and reveal its color.
4. Click on another card to try and find a match.
5. If the colors match, both cards will remain face-up.
6. If the colors do not match, the cards will flip back face-down.
7. Continue flipping cards until all pairs are found and all cards are face-up.
